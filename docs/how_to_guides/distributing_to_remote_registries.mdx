# Distributing OCI Artifacts to Remote Registries

## Authentication

Before pushing or pulling OCI Artifacts from a remote registry, 
we need to authenticate with the registry.
We can do so using the [`oras login`](../commands/oras_login.mdx) command.

We will be using [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as our example of a remote registry.

## Distribution of OCI artifacts

### Step 1: Create a sample file

```
echo "hello world" > artifact.txt
```

### Step 2: Push an artifact

You may refer to [`oras push`](../commands/oras_blob_push.mdx) for more details on which flags to use.

```bash
oras push docker.io/username/repository-name:v1 artifact.txt
```

```
Exists    a948904f2f0f artifact.txt
Pushed [registry] docker.io/username/repository-name:v1
Digest: sha256:528a33beb57f9e890c632178ef7c3ccbf89ee63fa06f050912f5b1acf56739ec
```

### Step 3: Pull the artifact

Let's now use [`oras pull`](../commands/oras_pull.mdx) to pull the artifact we pushed in the previous step.

```
oras pull docker.io/username/repository-name:v1
```

```

```

## View referrers 

We can use [`oras discover`](../commands/oras_discover.mdx) to view referrers.

```
oras discover docker.io/username/repository-name:v1
```

```
Discovered 0 artifact referencing v1
