# Distributing OCI Artifacts to Remote Registries

Remote OCI registries allow you to share container images and other artifacts.
There are many public and private remote registries available,
but this example uses [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](https://ghcr.io/).
This document covers the steps you need to preform to share artifacts on a remote registry.
You may also experiment with ORAS using a [local container registry](/quickstart.mdx) on your computer.

## Authentication

Most remote registry will require you to authenticte before you can push or pull artifacts.
The [`oras login`](/commands/oras_login.mdx) command is used for authentication.

On GHCR, you can get an authentication token by going to user Settings, Developer Settings,
Personal Access Tokens, and Tokens (classic).
GHCR currently only supports classic tokens for authentication.
Click on Generate New Token (classic) and allow read, write and delete packages.
Copy the generated token and set it to an environment variable.
The URL for GHCR is `ghcr.io`.

```bash
GHCR_USER='my_github_username'
GHCR_TOKEN='ghp_MYTOKEN'
echo "${GHCR_TOKEN}" | oras login --username "${GHCR_USER}" --password-stdin ghcr.io
```

## Create an artifact

An artifact shared on a registry could be a container image, helm chart or just a simple file.
This example will use a simple file:

```bash
echo "hello world" > artifact.txt
```

## Push the artifact

The [`oras push`](/commands/oras_push.mdx) is used to push artifacts to registries.

```bash
oras push ghcr.io/${GHCR_USER}/my-repository:v1 artifact.txt
```

The output will look something like this:
```

```

## Pull the artifact

Use the [`oras pull`](/commands/oras_pull.mdx) command to download the artifact.

```bash
oras pull ghcr.io/${GHCR_USER}/my-repository:v1
```

The output will look something like this:
```
✓ Pulled      artifact.txt                                                                                 12/12  B 100.00%    2ms

```

The file will be recreated if you deleted it:
```bash
% cat artifact.txt 
hello world
% 
```

## View referrers 

Use [`oras discover`](/commands/oras_discover.mdx) to view referrers.

```bash
oras discover ghcr.io/${GHCR_USER}/my-repository:v1
```

The output will look something like this:
```
ghcr.io/my_github_username/my-repository@sha256:b557297d52ec1bee854717827994fb616bffe936c583c7ce66fb21eb0c557df6
```
